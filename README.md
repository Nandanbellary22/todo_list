# todo_list
This is a program which allows you to add, remove or view the tasks from a list.
It is a console based interface where it asks the user what he wants to do.
I have done it using Python programming language.
I have used concepts like conditional statements, file statements, looping statements and a few formatting statements.
I have used sleep() method to create time-gap between print statements.
It also writes and removes task from a text file.
The program and the corresponding text file and images of the output are attached in the repository, feel free to check them out!
Thank you!
